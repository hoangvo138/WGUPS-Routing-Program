# WGUPS-Routing-Program-Python-3

## Scenario
The Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) needs to determine the best route and delivery distribution for their Daily Local Deliveries. 

The Salt Lake City DLD route has three trucks, two drivers, and an average of 40 packages to deliver each day; each package has specific criteria and delivery requirements.

Your task is to write code that determines and presents a solution delivering all 40 packages on time, according to their criteria while reducing the total number of miles traveled by the trucks. The “Salt Lake City Downtown Map,” provides the location of each address, and the “WGUPS Distance Table” provides the distance between each address.

The supervisor (user) should be able to check the status of any given package at any given time using package IDs, including the delivery times, which packages are at the hub, and which are en route.
